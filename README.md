Try to write a JavaScript function that beats the AI in a game called Five in
a Row.

## Five in a Row

Five in a Row, also known as Gomoku or Gobang, is a classic two-player strategy
board game that is played on a grid. The objective of the game is to be the
first player to form a continuous horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five
of their own pieces on the board.
